## Overview

Are you struggling with scattered Outlook data files? **PST Merge Tool** is a powerful Windows application designed to consolidate unlimited `.pst` files into one managed archive. Unlike paid alternatives, this tool is 100% free and open source.

It was built specifically to handle **large mailboxes (up to 2TB)** and includes a registry fix to bypass the default 50GB Outlook file size limit. Perfect for IT administrators performing backup recovery or users organizing years of emails.

## Features

- ✅ **Handles all item types** (Emails, Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, Notes)
- ✅ **Graceful cancellation** - stop safely without corrupting data
- ✅ **Persistent logging** - every action saved to a log file
- ✅ **Disk space validation** - warns before running out of space
- ✅ **Error resilience** - continues processing even if individual items fail

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server
- Microsoft Outlook installed (uses Outlook Interop)
- .NET Framework 4.5 or later

## Usage

1. **Download** the latest release from [Releases](../../releases)
2. **Run** `PstMerger.exe`
3. **Click "Fix PST Size Limits"** to remove the 50GB restriction (one-time setup)
4. **Select source folder** containing your PST files

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/PstMergeTool.git
cd PstMergeTool

# Build with MSBuild
msbuild PstMerger.csproj /p:Configuration=Release
```

The compiled executable will be in `bin\Release\PstMerger.exe`.

## How It Works

The tool uses Microsoft Outlook Interop to:
1. Open each source PST file
2. Recursively traverse all folders
3. Copy items to the destination PST, preserving folder structure
4. Safely close and detach each PST after processing

This ensures maximum compatibility and data integrity, as Outlook handles all the low-level PST format details.

## Registry Fix Details

By default, Outlook limits PST files to ~50GB. The "Fix PST Size Limits" button modifies:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Outlook\PST
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\PST
```

Setting `MaxLargeFileSize` and `WarnLargeFileSize` to ~2TB.
